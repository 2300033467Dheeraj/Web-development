# Community-Connect
"This is my first web development project, where I put my HTML, CSS, and React skills to the test. I followed the 80/20 ruleâ€”spending 20% of my time studying React and 80% implementing it. This hands-on approach helped me solidify my understanding and refine my web development skills."
