I completed learning JavaScript with some projects.
The projects include:

1. **Calculator**  
   This is a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Blackjack Game**  
   - This is a two-player game that I created using my knowledge of JavaScript.

3. **Sample Browser Extension**  
   - This is an extension that can be added to any browser by uploading the appropriate file. It allows users to save any text and website URL by interacting with the Chrome API with the click of a button. The extension uses local storage to ensure that the data is preserved even after closing the browser.

I have uploaded the projects and practice codes [here].

        - This is an extension that can be used to add any text and any website URL with a single button. This extension uses your local storage to store the data, so that the data will not be lost even if you close the browser.
