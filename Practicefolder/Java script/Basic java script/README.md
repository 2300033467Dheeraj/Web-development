I sucessfully completed learing JAVA SCRIPT with some projects.

The projects are:
1. Calculator
        - This is a simple calculator which can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
2. Black Jack game
        - This is a simple game which can be played by two players, with my knowledge of java script i created this game.
3. A sample Extention which can be used as extension in any browser by adding file in extension.
        - This is a extention which can be used to add any type of text and any web site URL with a single button in this extention this uses your local storage to store the data, so that data will not be lost even if you close the browser.

I uploaded projects and practice codes here.
I learned java script from youtube.
